The following is the command you should run in powershell to spin up Jupyter:
- docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -v "cd:/home/jovyan/work" jupyter/datascience-notebook:python-3.8.6

The command will produce 3 links at the end. Grab the last one and paste into browser. Should look something like this:
- http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=24bc33135f3c84b386cf51d33af79cad97700ecadbb15b8d
- ** Do not use this link. This is just an example. Each token in the URL is unique. **

Click and drag whatever files and notebooks you want to use onto the file explorer of the Jupyter browser window

If you want to run a whole notebook, open it and click the button to restart kernel and re run notebook

If you are using Visual Studio, you should be able to open the notebook on your IDE to view it as it has support for notebooks.
