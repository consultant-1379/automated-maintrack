### How to Retrain the AMT model ###

Step 1 - Get Training Data
- First step is making sure you run the generate dataset with the latest drops
-- Check the "how_to_scrape_data.info" file for how to do that
-- Once you run the generate dataset, a new file called training_dataset.csv should be created in this folder
-- This can take between 7 and 30 minutes depending on how many new slots you are scraping

Step 2 - Make a new model
- Spin up the python container and exec into it
- Run retrain_model.py by running: python miscellaneous/amt_ml_dataset_generator/retrain_model.py
-- Depending on the amount of data, this could take a few hours to run
-- Take note of the log line "SVC best score" as it gives us an indication of how good the data we have is
-- This will generate the file: model.pickle

Step 3 - Replace AMT's old model with new one
- Exit the container and cd into python directory once again (services/python)
- Use a docker cp command to copy the generated model out of the container and onto AMT
-- docker cp automated-maintrack_python_1:/usr/src/app/miscellaneous/amt_ml_dataset_generator/model.pickle machine_learning

Step 4 - Replace the sample dataset in AMT
- After the model has been retrained, rename the "training_dataset.csv" file that was used to train the model to "assertion_dataset_template.csv"
- Open "assertion_dataset_template.csv", delete all rows except the first row (headings)
- Now in the second row, add 0s for all columns except test suites which should be all 1s
-- For the PS column value place "TEMPLATE_PS"
-- For the DG Number column value place "TEMPLATE_DG"
-- Excel has features to help do this. Definitely don't do this manually
--- Check the existing AMT "assertion_dataset_template.csv" file if you are unsure on how to fill it in
- Delete the last column which is the "obsoleted" column
- Now replace the assertion_dataset_template.csv file in AMT with this new one
