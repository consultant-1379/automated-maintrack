Hi all,

This tool will be able to generate a CSV file to be used in ML
This CSV file contains the information on slots (and product sets) in a number of drops

The tool will only scrape drops that it doesnt have python pickles for. If there are pickles for a drop, it will use the
information in the pickles instead of scraping the drop. This saves A LOT of time.

The pickles contain information with the following combination of data:
-- No II or PASSED entries
-- No Rerunner
-- With current fixes

If you add any other fixes or want re runner results for example, you may want to backup the "ml_pickles" directory to
somewhere safe and then delete the one in the repo. This will make the scraper not use the pickles and run the scraper
E2E

To add re runner results, you must edit build_log_scraper.py line 228

To add II, PASSED you must add those options to the if statement of build_log_scraper.py lines 247-248

If you would like to use the scraper, please follow the following instructions.

Edit the variable "drops" in generate_dataset.py with whichever drop(s) you want to retrieve data for

Edit line 57 in html_getter.py by adding in the BumbleBee Functional User Password:
###########################################################
send_keys("PASSWORD_HERE") # BB Func User password
###########################################################

For these steps to work, Python 3.8 is required. Follow steps to config sys path vars etc.

You can use a headless browser like PhantomJS or Chromium for this. However, the code is setup to use Firefox.
Therefore the steps below are to get Firefox ready to run selenium

Install Firefox in your machine

Download the gecko driver and place it wherever you want (you will need to specify the path to it though)
Download the 64 bit version
- https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Edit your "Path" system variable and add the path to the gecko driver to it
NOTE: DONT UPDATE THE USER VARIABLES, ONLY SYSTEM VARIABLES
- Example "C:\Users\emesdel\geckodriver\geckodriver.exe"
- You may have to restart your laptop after this step if you get issues when running the tool

Pip install any python packages you may not have
- requests
- selenium
- beautifulsoup4

cd to python directory (services/python)
- Export the python path to where you are:
-- "eval 'export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)'"

Run the tool:
python miscellaneous/amt_ml_dataset_generator/generate_dataset.py
